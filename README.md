<H2><B> Title </B></H2> LLM Project to Build and Fine Tune a Large Language Model

<H2><B> Description </B></H2> Optimize their use through prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA.  The project also involves the application of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, resulting in the development of a chatbot for online shopping for knowledge grounding.

<br>
● Dialogue Summarization Task:
<br>
○ Implementation of prompt engineering on a dialogue summarization task,
showcasing practical application.
<br>

● Fine Tuning and PEFT:
<br>
○ Implementing full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on
dialogue summarization.
<br>
○ Model evaluation using ROUGE metrics for performance assessment.
<br>

● RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback):
<br>
○ Explanation and exploration of the RLHF concept
<br>

● Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):
<br>
○ Practical implementation of RAG using OpenAI's GPT3.5 for creating a
chatbot.
<br>

● Development of Chatbot Application:
<br>
○ Step-by-step guide on building a functional chatbot application for online
